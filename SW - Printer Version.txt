# EA to pull driver version of the last used printer
# https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/10384/extension-attribute-for-printer-driver-version

# why would we use this?
# one EA to get a specific printer queue's driver version could then be basis of a smart group
# (if printer name = X and version != Y)

# globals

ppdDir=$(/etc/cups/ppd)

printer="YourPrinter" # needs to be the CUPS queue name, not whats shown in Sys Prefs/Settings

# just for fun, let's parse the most recently-used queue name
# printer=$(lpstat -W all | awk 'END { print $1 } ' | cut -d - -f 1) 


# grab the driver version

driverVer=$(cat $ppdDir/$printer.ppd | awk '/FileVersion/{ gsub(/"/,""); print $2 })

echo "<result>$driverVer</result>"
